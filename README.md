# Predicting-Cars-Price-based-on-historical-data
This project delves into a comprehensive car dataset, aiming to uncover valuable insights and patterns hidden within the data. Through meticulous analysis and exploration, we seek to understand the characteristics, relationships, and trends associated with various car attributes.

The dataset encompasses a wide range of car features, including make, model, year, engine size, horsepower, fuel type, transmission, and more. This richness in data provides a solid foundation for extracting meaningful information and building predictive models.

Our primary objective is to explore the relationships between car features and identify key factors that influence car performance, fuel efficiency, and overall desirability. We will employ various data analysis techniques, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and visualization tools.

By examining the distribution of car attributes, we can gain insights into the most common car types, engine sizes, fuel preferences, and transmission choices. Furthermore, we will investigate the relationships between these attributes and other variables such as horsepower, torque, and fuel economy.
